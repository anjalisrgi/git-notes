*What is git and difference between git and github?
Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows you to track changes to files and coordinate work among multiple people on a project. It keeps track of changes to files, allows you to revert to previous stages, and enables collaboration through branching and merging.
         Git is the version control system that manages your project's source code history, while GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories with additional collaboration features.
